# MOODetail (backend)

MOODetail is a Single Page Application using React/Redux on the frontend and a Rails API backend with PostgreSQL handling the database.  This repository is for the Rails API backend (the frontend can be found at https://github.com/maasa-k/moodetail-frontend).  This app is for keeping track of what prompts certain moods, and to distinguish between those that are within your control and those that are out of your control. 

## Installation and Starting Servers

## Rails:

Navigate to the directory for the backend and run the followinglines of code to install:

```
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

To start the Rails server: 
```
rails s
```

To stop the Rails server:
`Ctrl` + `C`

## PostgreSQL:

Make sure to also start the PostgreSQL database server:
```
service postgresql start
```

To stop the PostgresQL databaser server:
```
service postgresql stop
```

You may need to add `sudo` to the beginning of the above lines of code. 

## Usage

After seeding the database for the mood states through the Rails API backend and starting the React/Redux server on the frontend (separate repository), you can begin entering descriptions of promtps to various moods.  From the moods index page, click on a mood to see that mood's show page which includes the input form for entering a new prompt.  Once submitted, the description will append to either the "Within my control" or "Out of my control" card and will save to the database.
